# Title     : sc_rate.pl  (or sc_rate in certain cases)
# Usage     : sc_rate.pl test_file.msf [test_structure_file.jp]
# Function  : Evaluates the quality of any sequence alignment.
#             This caculates, basically, the Sequence identity(in %) divided
#             by Composition identity rate of sequences with certain scanning
#             window size of (8 ~ 24)
# Example   : sc_rate.pl aa.msf aa.jp
# Warning   : Takes 'ALIGNED' sequences. So, need at least a pair of seqs aligned.
# Class     : Bio
# Keywords  : SC rate, Sequence identity, composition identity
# Options   : Following vars are read into the program at initialization by &parse_arguments
#             subroutine, so please leave them. It is not just comments.
#    $av_sc_segment     becomes    1  by  a  # To smooth the SC rates
